### Why I chose MIT License?

MIT license is simple, flexible, and has few restrictions on permissions.
The MIT License is also easy to use because it is compatible with other licenses and easy to integrate with other projects and code bases. Thus, we adopted the MIT License because it is a highly flexible license that is in the spirit of open source.
